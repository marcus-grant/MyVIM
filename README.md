# MyVIM

My personal vim setup which later in this document I will detail the setup for.

### To-Do
- Add gitignore rules to make the bundle directories empty, leaving only the vundle.vim file within a Vundle.vim folder. There might need to be some trick to ignore the .git within there as well
- Script to handle initial install since there's at least 3 steps to getting this to work
- Proper README with write up for how to setup these options yourself that reflects my blog post about it
